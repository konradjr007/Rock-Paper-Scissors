#### _The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a classic hand game played between two people._
> Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes: rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined  based on the following rules:

- Rock vs. Paper: Paper wins.
- Rock vs. Scissors: Rock wins.
- Paper vs. Scissors: Scissors wins.
 
> In this program:
- The user enters their choice (â€˜sâ€™ for stone, â€˜pâ€™ for paper, or â€˜zâ€™ for scissors).
- The computer generates a random choice.
- The game() function compares the choices and determines the winner.
